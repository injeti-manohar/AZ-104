### Subscription

- Each subscription offers Different Billing Period, Resources and Reporting features.

     *Like in Azure for Student Subscription, You Can't Use AZURE CDN ; While in PAY-AS-GO You can !!*
     Also You can't setup Billig alerts in AZ for Student. You can't see the credits remaining from the portal.
     Another example -- FOR Enterprise Agreement You PAY ANNUALLY. while In PAY-AS-GO MONTHLLY

- Billing boundary : When Billed, How much can you spend (Free trial Has $200 Credits, PAY-AS-GO -> No limit `unless you create a limit`)
- Access control boundary : Give, Remove permissions on Subscription level.

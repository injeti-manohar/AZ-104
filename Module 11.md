### Azure Monitor
enables you to gather monitoring and diagnostic information about the health of your services. You can use this information to visualize and analyze the causes of problems that might occur in your app.

#key ability

> All data collected by Azure Monitor fits into one of two fundamental types, metrics and logs.
### metrics and logs

### Metrics & logs

considered as the pillars of observability

Log -- 

Metric -- easy to view and find in a complex interconnected system compared to logs

### Data types 
----
> Activity Logs record when resources are created or modified. Metrics tell you how the resource is performing and the resources it is consuming.


With the Activity Log, you can determine the ‘what, who, and when’ for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) taken on the resources in your subscription

- Through activity logs, you can determine:

What operations were taken on the resources in your subscription?
✓ Who started the operation?
✓ When the operation occurred?
✓ The status of the operation.
✓ The values of other properties that might help you research the operation.

Log actual operation of the resources by enabling diagnostics and adding an agent to compute resources
